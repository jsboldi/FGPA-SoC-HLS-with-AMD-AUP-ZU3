Welcome to the FPGA-SoC-HLS curriculum site, where we will be learning how to program and interface with the AMD AUP-ZU3.

FPGA's are a type of compute used in various application. FPGA stands for Field programmable gate array. an FPGA is a reconfigurable 
programmable compute unit that is made of memories, configurable logic blocks, programmable interconnects and other hard logic blocks like DSP's.
This course will teach you how to interface with these FPGA boards using the AMD software suite: Vivado and Vitis. Vivado is a program from AMD that can simulate verilog code and testbenches, synthesize RTL code,
implement the RTL code, and finally program the bitstream to the FPGA board. Vitis is a tool that is used for HLS (High level synthesis), where experienced designers can use c++ code to describe their design, and Vitis will
synthesize that to RTL and a Vivado IP.
